Hi there! 

This is my project for Hackclub Blueprint. It is an AI bot that you can chat with and that will respond to you!

Whats in it:
Raspberry Pi
A Mic
A Speaker
A Screen
A Potentiometer
The Case

What it should do: When you say "Hey Clippy" and then what ever you want to for example "what is 1+1" it should respond with "1+1 is 2" The code basically just checks to see if anyone said "Hey clippy" and if someone did then it connects to chatgpt and inputs whatever the person says. On the screen it will show clippy till you say something then it will show whatever chatgpt is responding with as well as say it out loud.
To make this on your own get the matireals listed above and use my code!
