## 10/19/2025 12 PM - Created BOM.csv and started case  

What I did: I made the BOM.csv file with the microphone and screen. I also began the case that will hold the Raspberry Pi, screen, microphone, and potentiometer.

How I did it: I researched the cheapest parts based on my plan and added them to the BOM. For the case I started by making the project files and adding the pieces needed.

What went well: I was able to find affordable components and made my BOM easily.

Next steps: I’ll finish the case, then move on to writing the README and starting the code.

## 10/19/2025 1 PM - Finished Case  

What I did: I completed the case.

How I did it: I added cutouts for the screen's pins and potentiometer. Since the screen’s pin dimensions weren’t on amazon, I estimated and adjusted the model accordingly. As for the mic it will be hidden inside the case and placed down by the ventilation holes. 

What went well: The case is the exact size of the raspberry pi 3 and the components should fit cleanly in the lid and box.
Challenges: I’ll need to check if the screen fits after the screen and box arrive. If the screen does not fit I will cut out the hole so the screen does fit.

## 10/19/2025 2 PM - Made README.md  

What I did: I wrote the README.md file and uploaded the .STEP file for the case.

How I did it: The README is a basic description of Clippy, the things I used, and what its basic functions should be. 

What went well: The README.md tells the reader what the project should do and the materials used.

## 10/19/2025 4 PM - Hardware Switch & Planning Code  

What I did: I was starting the code for the Arduino Uno and then when looking through the specs to make sure that it would work to handle all the code on it's own I realized that it couldn’t handle Clippy’s requirements, so I looked at what I had and decided to use a Raspberry pi 3b instead.

How I did it: I reviewed the limitations of the Arduino Uno Rev 3 on the arduino web site and checked to see its processing power and capabilities. Once I concluded that the Arduino Uno could not handle the code I checked what other equipment I already had to make sure I did not spend anything extra and decided to use my Raspberry Pi 3b. The Pi supports Python and has enough processing power for voice input and screen output.

What went well: The switch made my project work and let me use improved items to make it run better. 

Next steps: Update the README.md and begin coding. Coding will include adding the speech recognition for "Hey Clippy" and then adding the code to make it use chatgpt. After that I will work on adding captions on the screen and adding the image of clippy which is a bitmap I already have. ![Copilot_20251019_160913](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjYxOSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--0a99657d531e77888246fecb3cab814a30b3b4c3/Copilot_20251019_160913.png)

  

## 10/24/2025 - Wrote The Code  

What I did: I used python to create the code. After writing the code in VS Code, I deployed it to the Raspberry Pi. I first got Raspberry Pi OS on my Raspberry Pi to be able to run my code. I then installed all required libraries to run my code and cloned my github repository, which contained the code.

How I did it: I controlled my components using the RPi.GPIO library. I started configuring the microphone using Python's audio libraries. Additionally, I installed packages to support potentiometer readings and speaker output. In order to make updates after the items arrived easy, I wrote the code to keep each hardware function modular.

What went well: The Raspberry Pi booted successfully, and the libraries downloaded quickly. The code compiled without issues which was good.

Challenges: I had to troubleshoot some GPIO pin assignments and adjust screen resolution settings to match the display size. Installing the correct audio libraries for the microphone and speaker also took some trial and error.

Next steps: I plan to refine the code once all the parts arrive if my project gets approved. ![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjYyNywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--21c052fae998170571d86fef1f60d7ece5c18f91/image.png)
