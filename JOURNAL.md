## 10/19/2025 12 PM - Created BOM.csv and started case  

I created the VOM.csv and added the two things i need. I started the case which will hold the arduino uno, screen, microphone, and the potentiometer. I will start the read me after i finish the case and then i will get started on the code which will be fun!![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzQ5MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--6c1ab0dc6dcb40eb70ea85667d0b9ea191ca3116/image.png)
  

## 10/19/2025 1 PM - Finished Case  

I finished my first version of the case I will probably make it better later. I am going to work on my read me file and then I will start my code and update my case to complete everything I will also add cheaper items to my BOM.csv I think I can reduce the price more.

## 10/19/2025 2 PM - Made README.md  

I created the README.md file and finished my case! I also uploaded the .step file for the case 3d model. I will work on the code now! After the code I will be done with this and can ship it! I think that the code is probably going to be the hardest part of this.![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzU1MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--96ef67d64dd0cff751b4d2a27a48102a858159a8/image.png)
