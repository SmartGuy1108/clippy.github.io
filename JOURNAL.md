## 10/19/2025 12 PM - Created BOM.csv and started case  

I created the VOM.csv and added the two things i need. I started the case which will hold the raspberry i 3 b, screen, microphone, and the potentiometer. I will start the read me after i finish the case and then i will get started on the code which will be fun!![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzQ5MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--6c1ab0dc6dcb40eb70ea85667d0b9ea191ca3116/image.png)
  

## 10/19/2025 1 PM - Finished Case  

I finished my first version of the case I will probably make it better later. I am going to work on my read me file and then I will start my code and update my case to complete everything I will also add cheaper items to my BOM.csv I think I can reduce the price more.

## 10/19/2025 2 PM - Made README.md  

I created the README.md file and finished my case! I also uploaded the .step file for the case 3d model. I will work on the code now! After the code I will be done with this and can ship it! I think that the code is probably going to be the hardest part of this.![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzU1MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--96ef67d64dd0cff751b4d2a27a48102a858159a8/image.png)
  

## 10/19/2025 4 PM - Finished the first version of the code!  

As I started making the code I realized that a Arduino uno will not be able to run this so I changed it to a raspberry pi so it can run on its own. After changing it I had to update the BOM with compatible items which were also cheaper. I updated everything and found a image to use for the face of Clip![Copilot_20251019_160913.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzU2NCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--aee6a1adade9037e77ae5d2e2fb020725f47b18a/Copilot_20251019_160913.png)

## 10/24/2025 - Added Models of Final Design  

I added the designs of how the final model should look and in the process I also learnt how to use on shape. Also please ignore the PCB journal entry because I posted it in the wrong project and it wont let me delete it.![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTM1OCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--9c788d728c64039b5e1212e025c0269686ac2e26/image.png)
