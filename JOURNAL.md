## 10/19/2025 12 PM - Created BOM.csv and started case  

What I did: I made the BOM.csv file with the microphone and screen. I also began the case that will hold the Raspberry Pi, screen, microphone, and potentiometer.

How I did it: I researched the cheapest parts based on my plan and added them to the BOM. For the case I started by making the project files and adding the pieces needed.

What went well: I was able to find affordable components and made my BOM easily.

Next steps: I’ll finish the case, then move on to writing the README and starting the code.

## 10/19/2025 1 PM - Finished Case  

What I did: I completed the case.

How I did it: I added cutouts for the screen's pins and potentiometer. Since the screen’s pin dimensions weren’t on amazon, I estimated and adjusted the model accordingly. As for the mic it will be hidden inside the case and placed down by the ventilation holes. 

What went well: The case is the exact size of the raspberry pi 3 and the components should fit cleanly in the lid and box.
Challenges: I’ll need to check if the screen fits after the screen and box arrive. If the screen does not fit I will cut out the hole so the screen does fit.

## 10/19/2025 2 PM - Made README.md  

What I did: I wrote the README.md file and uploaded the .STEP file for the case.

How I did it: The README is a basic description of Clippy, the things I used, and what its basic functions should be. 

What went well: The README.md tells the reader what the project should do and the materials used.

## 10/19/2025 4 PM - Finished the code  

As I started making the code I realized that a Arduino uno will not be able to run this so I changed it to a raspberry pi so it can run on its own without needing any external connections to help it run. After changing it I had to update the BOM with compatible items which were also cheaper. I updated everything and found a image to use for the face of Clippy! I am going to find things to make the final product better like maybe a power bank so it does not always need to be connected to a charger![Copilot_20251019_160913.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzU2NCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--aee6a1adade9037e77ae5d2e2fb020725f47b18a/Copilot_20251019_160913.png)
  

## 10/24/2025 - Added Models of Final Design  

I added the designs of how the final product should look and in the process, I also learnt how to use on shape. It took a while for me to learn on shape but once I did learn it was rally easy to use. I will probably have to update my BOM and final model because I plan on adding more features. I also realized that I forgot to add a speaker which I will add now!![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTM1OCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--9c788d728c64039b5e1212e025c0269686ac2e26/image.png)
